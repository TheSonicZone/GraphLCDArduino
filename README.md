Graphics LCD tinkering with the Arduino Uno

## This is a sketch for the Arduino Uno that was used to test a T6963C based LCD and understand how it works in the presence of contradictory information all over the internet, and a really badly translated original datasheet from '97 published by Toshiba themselves.

## Usage
Designed to run on a standard Uno, and a 128 x 128 pixel LCD attached. Simple modifications means it can be changed to suit any LCD running with a T6963C controller.

## What this code does
- Initialisation of the T6963C
- Clear text and graphics memory
- Display some static images
- Play an animation consisting of 5 frames
